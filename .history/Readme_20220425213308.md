# Boss Sensor

implanting a sensor and notify users when someone is approaching. Based on the change of the distance (i.e. when someone goes through the door, the distance captured by the rangefinder will first decrease and then go back), our sensor could tell if the bosses are approaching and notify users through sending emails by wifi module.
